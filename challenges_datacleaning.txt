Challenges with data cleaning:
Username
- Duplicate users: 
	- How many tweets from duplicate user?
	- Is there a combination of positive and negative tweets?
		- This is necessary for Dprep and not oDCM. The textblob function in R looks like this for example: Sentiment(classification='pos', p_pos=0.5057908299783777, p_neg=0.49420917002162196)--> Here classified as positive sentiment as seen on:https://stackabuse.com/sentiment-analysis-in-python-with-textblob/, but why tho, since it is almost 50/50.
	- Is it possible to delete all but one tweet without jeopardizing the data analysis?
- Text:
	- Remove 'Replying to' and user handles from tweet text
	- Decoding non-ASCII encodings (e.g. @thierrybaudet!âƒ or #wappies â€™Ik blijf)
		- Is there an easier way than examples like this on stackflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42959434/decode-non-ascii-characters-in-an-ascii-file
- Reply.count:
	- Remove NA and replace thousands (e.g. 1.9k) by 1900
- Retweets:
	- Remove NA and replace thousands (e.g. 1.9k) by 1900
- Like.count
	- Remove NA and replace thousands (e.g. 1.9k) by 1900
